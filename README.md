# Grapher
An online grapher and calculus solver

See it in action here: http://the-ofek-foundation.github.io/Grapher/

The usage should be pretty self-explanitory, keep in mind that graphs don't delete or change unless you specifically clear them (select 'Clear' from the dropdown and then evaluate or hit 'enter').

##### List of settings that you can change (after hitting the settings icon):
1. increment (step size when drawing)
2. show/hide lines (connect the dots between steps)
3. domain/range (Change the domain or range of the function)

Let me know if you have any suggestions or want to see anything!
